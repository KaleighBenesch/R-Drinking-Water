# R-Drinking-Water
## Drinking water standards in the United States.

A capstone experience in which I consider scientific questions, as they relate to drinking water samples in the United States. I have collected and analyzed the data and communicated my findings effectively.

In this project, I have demonstrated the following skills:
  - Collect and manage data to solve the problem at hand
  - Evaluate and implement multiple statistical procedures to answer a particular question of interest using data
  - Apply appropriate computing/programming skills to answer a scientific question
  - Communicate the results from a statistical analysis orally and in writing in an appropriate level of detail for an intended audience
